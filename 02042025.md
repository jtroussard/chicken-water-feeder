# Meeting Minutes: Arduino Temperature Sensor Project

## Date: 2025-02-04

## Attendees: Jacques Troussard, Christopher

1. Project Overview:

   - Setting up a temperature sensor with an Arduino[#1][#2]

   - Troubleshooting sensor readings[#3][#4]

2. Progress:

   - Attempted different wiring configurations[#5][#6]

   - Changed data pin from 10 to 2[#7][#8]

   - Reviewed sensor datasheet[#9]

3. Issues Encountered:

   - Extreme temperature readings (-127Â°C)[#10][#11]

   - Possible wiring or connection problems[#12][#13]

4. Next Steps:

   - Purchase alligator clips for better connections[#14][#15]

   - Try manually adding a pull-up resistor[#16]

   - Verify proper wiring for the temperature sensor[#17][#18]

   - Add error handling code to Arduino sketch[#19]

5. Action Items:

   - Jacques: Acquire alligator clips, test manual pull-up resistor[#20]

   - Both: Schedule next meeting in two weeks for longer session[#21][#22]

6. Next Meeting: TBD (in two weeks)[#23][#24]
