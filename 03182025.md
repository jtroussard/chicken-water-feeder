# Today

Today we converted the system from Ardunio to the Rpi platform. Using Rpi 3B+ we rewired the system and used chatgpt to quickly convert our code.
The code is still very simple, as it is just a single run file. We needed to go into the Rpi settings and enable a '1-wire' communication protocal,
which appears to be linked by default to the GPIO4 pin. Once we ran the system we observed the temperature outout values on the terminal and used a 
glass of ice water to cool the temperature prob and observe the temperature readings drop. Like the value outputs the leds behaved as expceted as
well, when the temperature threshold was broken (below 22*C) the red led turned on and the green shut off, the opposite occured once the the sensor
readings reached above the threshold. Christopher also prototyped the relay connection, and tested it out. While we will still need to figure out how
to build our own cusotm circuit for the relay and heater, we know in theory what the circuit should look like.

# Tomorrow

We discussed our plans for the next few meetings.

## Pre-meeting

- gather necessary items to build our custom high voltage circuit
  - two prong wall socket
  - two prong electrical cord plug replacement
  - wire connectors (twist caps?)
- build a dashboard for the Rpi and simplify sharing the output

## 04/03/2025

- build the high voltage circuit
- verify high voltage circuit
- install high voltage circuit to the system
- test the complete prototype

## 04/17/2025

- Document the prototype thoroughly
- Shelf the prototype
- Design the production unit
  - shopping list
    - electrical
    - mechanical/hardware
  - rough draft skematics
 
Then the plan is to in our free time perfect the design/skematics before we are able to meet in person and undertake the final production build, concluding this project.
